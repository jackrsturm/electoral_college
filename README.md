# electoral_college

This project was created to analyze the Unequitable Representation under the Electoral College. 

Here are the files:
2020_turnout_rates - This contains voter data from the 2020 election (from US Election Project). This data is used for population estimates.

electoral_votes_per_state - This contains the number of electoral votes per state

Voting Power.ipynb - This is the Python code (a Jupyter project) used to complete the project

The pictures are visulations created which show the "voting power index" i.e. the number of people per electoral vote in each state
